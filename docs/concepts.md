# Core Concepts

## Folder

An optional top-level logical grouping, relating to business domain, team, project or anything at all.  Sub-groupings can be created by nesting folders.

## Pipeline

Pipelines have a one-to-one mapping with Github repositories and define the workflow of stages required to test, build, and deploy applications.  Can be grouped into folders.

## Stage

Stages are distinct pipeline steps concerned with specific tasks e.g. running unit tests, building distributable binaries, and deploying infrastructure.

## Run

A run represents an individual execution of a pipeline and the result of that execution.
